//! Wake-payload construction: the text a due Stop hook prints to stderr and
//! exits 2 with, so Claude Code wakes the idle session and shows it as a
//! system reminder. The woken model reads the payload and spawns the due
//! forks as background `fork` subagents (Agent tool, `subagent_type: "fork"`).
//!
//! The parent model is told to spawn each fork with a prompt that makes the
//! *fork* read the fork file — the parent must never read it itself.
//!
//! `after` dependencies are daemon-enforced: a wake carries only the roots of
//! the due set, dependents are held by the daemon (with a one-line note here
//! so the visible payload explains itself), and when the daemon observes a
//! predecessor's completion it answers the next parked Stop poll with a
//! *release* payload ([`build_release_payload`]) for the now-unblocked forks.
